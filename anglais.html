So i was hesitating between two courses training  <a href="https://www.iutmulhouse.uha.fr/diplomes/but-bachelor-universitaire-technologique/b-u-t-genie-mecanique-et-productiquegmp/"> GMP</a> Mechanical and production engineering (Génie mécanique et productique in french) and <a href="https://www.iutcolmar.uha.fr/index.php/formations/diplomes/bachelor-universitaire-de-technologie-b-u-t-bac-3/b-u-t-reseaux-et-telecommunications/">RT</a> networks and telecommunications (réseaux et télécommunication in french ). So i put these two training on parcoursup but for the Mechanical and production engineering i was refused. So that’s why I got into networks and telecommunications. Now that I am in RT all I have to do is find my way between the three specialties</p>
