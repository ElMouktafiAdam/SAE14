    <h2> what is handball?</h2>

    <article class="handballcquoi">
        Handball is a team sport played by hand, in which two teams of seven players 
        compete with a ball on a rectangular pitch measuring 40 m by 20 m, divided into two halves.
        The winning team is the one that has scored the most goals at the end of the allotted time, generally two 30-minute periods. 
        A team is normally made up of a goalkeeper and six outfield players, usually divided into two wingers (right and left), two full-backs (right and left), a centre-half (or centre-back)
        and a pivot

    <h2> the rules </h2>
    
    <article class="regle"> 
        In handball, the aim of the game is to get the ball into the opponent's goal more times than your opponent, using only your hands to handle the ball.
        The idea is to dribble with the ball or pass it to a team-mate. Once they have the ball in their hands 
        the player may dribble forward but may only take three steps without dribbling and may not hold on to the ball for more than three seconds if he or she remains stationary.
        A match pits two teams against each other and is generally played in two 30-minute halves, separated by a 10-minute break. A team is made up of up to 14 players,
        Only 7 players may be on the pitch at any one time, the others being substitutes10. However, the international (IHF), continental and national federations have the option of reducing
        regulations to allow 16 players per team to be registered on the match sheet10. The number of substitutions during a match is unlimited.
        Through a sideline: the team that touched the ball last concedes a touch to the opposing team. The ball is put back into play by being thrown in from outside the pitch, at the point where the ball left the pitch, by a player from the opposing team who must place one foot on the touch line.
        Through a back line: the ball goes back to the goalkeeper if it is an opposing player or the goalkeeper himself who puts it behind the line. If it is a defender who touches the ball last, and the ball goes behind his own goal line (by countering it, for example), 
        the ball is recovered by the opposing team via a corner throw (equivalent to a corner in football), unless the goalkeeper touches the ball again within the 6-metre zone.</article>

    <h2> French men's team </h2>

    <article class="edfm">
        <p>
            Three-time Olympic champions, six-time world champions and three-time European champions, they are the most successful handball team of all time.
            Nicknamed the "Bronzés" in 1992, the "Barjots" from 1993 to 1996 and the "Costauds" from 2001 to 2008, it is the generation nicknamed "Les Experts" from 2008 to 2017 that is considered the most talented of all. 
            that is considered to be the most talented in the history of international handball, ahead of the Swedish team of the 
            1990. From the mid-2000s onwards, this generation succeeded in doing with the same core of players what no other men's national team had ever achieved before: they built up a reputation for excellence in a few short years.
            In the space of just a few years, they built up a unique trophy cabinet, winning nine titles out of the fifteen competitions they contested between 2006 and 2017. The only 
            men's team to retain an Olympic title in the sport1 (victories in 2008 and 2012), it is also the first and only team to have won all three major trophies simultaneously (Olympic Games, World Cup and World Cup). 
            the three major trophies (Olympic Games, World Championship, European Championship).

    <h2> French women's team </h2>

    <article class="edff">
        <p>
            The French women's handball team represents the French Handball Federation in three major international competitions: the Summer Olympics, the World Championships and the European Championships,
            the World Championship and the European Championship, all of which it has won. Under the same coach, Olivier Krumbholz, from
            Since 1999, the team has won twelve medals at major international events, including a first title at the 2003 World Championships in Croatia and a second fourteen years later,
            at the 2017 World Championships in Germany, more than a year after winning the silver medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
            Exceptionally, the men's and women's national handball teams are world champions in the same year. Like their male counterparts in 2010 and 2015,
            in 2018, Les Bleues hold the world and European titles simultaneously, following their first victory on the continental stage, at home in Bercy on 16 December 
            in the final against Russia. This victory means they qualify directly for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games
